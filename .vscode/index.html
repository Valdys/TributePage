          <li><strong>5 May 1838</strong> - In Saint Petersburg Shevchenko met Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko,
             who introduced him to other compatriots such as Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych,
              and to Russian painter Alexey Venetsianov. 
              Through these men Shevchenko also met famous painter and professor Karl Briullov,
               who donated his portrait of Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky as a lottery prize.
             Its proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's freedom</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1838</strong> - Shevchenko was accepted as a student into the Academy of Arts in the workshop of Karl Briullov.

          <li>

          </li>
          <li><strong>1844</strong> - distressed by the condition of Ukrainian regions in the Russian Empire,
             Shevchenko decided to capture some of his homeland's historical ruins and cultural monuments in an album of etchings,
              which he called Picturesque Ukraine.
             Only the first six etchings were printed because of the lack of means to continue.</li>
          <li><strong>22 March 1845</strong> - the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title of a non-classed artist. 
            He again traveled to Ukraine where he met with historian Nikolay Kostomarov and other members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius,
             a clandestine society also known as Ukrainian-Slavic society
              and dedicated to the political liberalization of the Empire and its transformation into a federation-like polity of Slavic nations.</li>
          <li><strong>5 April 1847</strong> - Shevchenko was arrested together with the members of the society.
            Tsar Nicholas I read Shevchenko's poem, "Dream". 
            Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well,
             laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself,
             but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife.
             Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy appearance and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family.
              After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated "I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has she done to deserve this?"</li>
              While under investigation, Shevchenko was imprisoned in Saint Petersburg in casemates of the 3rd Department of Imperial Chancellery on Panteleimonovskaya Street (today Pestelia str., 9). After being convicted,
               he was exiled as a private to the Russian military garrison in Orenburg at Orsk, near the Ural Mountains. 
              <li><strong>1848</strong> - he was assigned to undertake the first Russian naval expedition of the Aral Sea on the ship "Konstantin",
                 under the command of Lieutenant Butakov. 
                 Although officially a common private, Shevchenko was effectively treated as an equal by the other members of the expedition.
                  He was tasked to sketch various landscapes around the coast of the Aral Sea. 
                  After an 18-month voyage <strong>(1848–1849)</strong> Shevchenko returned with his album of drawings and paintings to Orenburg. 
                Most of those drawings were created for a detailed account of the expedition.</li>
                <li>He was then sent to one of the worst penal settlements, the remote fortress of Novopetrovsk at Mangyshlak Peninsula,
                     where he spent seven terrible years. In <strong>1851</strong>, at the suggestion of fellow serviceman Bronisław Zaleski,
                      lieutenant colonel Mayevsky assigned him to the Mangyshlak (Karatau) geological expedition. In <strong>1857</strong> Shevchenko finally returned from exile after receiving amnesty from a new emperor,
                       though he was not permitted to return to St.
                     Petersburg and was forced to stay in Nizhniy Novgorod.</li>
          <li><strong>1859</strong> - Shevchenko got permission to return to Ukraine.
             He intended to buy a plot of land close to the village Pekari.
             In July, he was again arrested on a charge of blasphemy, but then released and ordered to return to St. Petersburg.</li>
          <li><strong>10 March 1861</strong> - Shevchenko died in Saint Petersburg </li>
